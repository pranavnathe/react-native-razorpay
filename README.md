# Full Stack React Native App with Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration

This project is a **full-stack React Native** application integrated with **Razorpay Payment Gateway**. The app allows users to enter payment details, which are processed through Razorpay. The backend, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, manages the order creation, payment verification, and stores the payment details.

### Key Features:

-   User-friendly interface for entering payment details (amount, name, email, and contact number).
-   The backend creates an order using the Razorpay API.
-   Seamless payment flow with Razorpay checkout integration.
-   Payment verification via the Razorpay API to ensure successful transaction completion.
-   Real-time updates on the payment status.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following set up:

### 1. React Native Environment

-   Make sure you have **React Native** environment set up. Follow the official guide for setting up React Native for Android: [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### 2. MongoDB

-   Ensure **MongoDB** is installed and running on your system. If not, follow the installation guide: [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

## .env Configuration

### Frontend (`React Native`):

In the root of your **frontend** project, create a `.env` file and set the following:

```env
API_URL = # Backend URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = # Your Razorpay Key ID
```

### Backend (`Node.js & Express`):

In the root of your **frontend** project, create a `.env` file and set the following:

```env
PORT = 8000
NODE_ENV = development
MONGODB_URL = mongodb://localhost:27017
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = # Your Razorpay Key ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = # Your Razorpay Key Secret
```

## Running the Project

### Frontend (`React Native`):

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd Payment
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the app on your physical Android device:
    ```bash
    npm run android
    ```
    Ensure you are using a physical device, as Razorpay checkout may not work correctly on emulators.

### Backend (`Node.js & Express`):

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Using ngrok to Generate a Public API URL

### Why Use ngrok?

When developing this project locally, the backend server (running on port 8000) is only accessible within your local network. However, services like **Razorpay** require a publicly accessible URL to communicate with your backend, especially for payment verification. This is where **ngrok** comes in.

**ngrok** creates a secure tunnel from a public URL (e.g., `http://xyz123.ngrok.io`) to your locally running backend, making it accessible over the internet. This allows Razorpay's API to communicate with your local server even though it's running in your local development environment.

### Steps to Use ngrok:

1. **Install ngrok**:
   If you haven't already, install **ngrok** by following the instructions on the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).

2. **Start ngrok**:
   After installing **ngrok**, open a terminal and run the following command to expose your local backend server running on port 8000:

    ```bash
    ngrok http http://localhost:8000
    ```
